            <h1>About This Project</h1>
            <p>This is a final project for ENVS1400: Sustainable Design in the Built Environment, taught by
                professor Kurt Teichert at Brown University. In this class, students learn the methods of
                reducing the environemntal impact of the built environment (think buildings, houses, apartments, etc.). </p>
            <p>While learning about the contents of this class, and in particular the very
            scientific methods of calculating solar gain, heat loss coefficients, etc. I couldn't
            help noticing how, in the end, the clean energy recommendations created through these methods
            are very similar to the unsolicited remarks by my grandmother on the buildings of Chicago
            every time she visited from China.</p>
            <p>Unlike the numbers and scientific methods used in this course, my grandmother
            would always explain her opinions through <i>Feng Shui</i>. Any building facing somewhere
            other than South is bad. Trees are good depending on where they're placed. Furniture must
            be arranged in a particular way. I'd always assumed it to be old people superstition
            until I heard eeriely similar suggestions in this course, explained through a much more
            academic and Western lens. </p>
            <p>Growing up in the United States, I'd always disregarded traditional Chinese
                art forms and beliefs as superstition and outdated. Throuhgout the course of this class,
                I'd come to respect the wisdom of <i>Feng Shui</i> in particular, even if
                it does not completely correlate with what is taught in Western societies as scientific or "advanced".
                Through this project, I hope to better understand <i>Feng Shui</i> and how it
            applies to the built environment and creating a more sustainable future, and I hope you do as well!</p>

            <h1><i>Feng Shui</i>: a general overview</h1>
            <p><i>Feng Shui</i>, translated literally as “wind” and “water”,
                is rooted in the Chinese philosophy of harmonious coexistence between humans and nature.
                While the philosophy of <i>Feng Shui</i> itself goes beyond environmental design,
                there are many principles we can learn from Feng Shui to better design for the
                built environment. In this project, I will be exploring 3 principles of
                <i>Feng Shui</i> to understand their correlation to sustainable design principles.
                Note: <i>Feng Shui</i> is a deeply complex art and I’m barely scratching the surface here.
                Many of my explanations are geared towards the environmental built environment perspective,
                which may veer from the traditional explanations of <i>Feng Shui</i>, but hopefully this can help you get
                a better sense of the relationships between <i>Feng Shui</i>
                and environmental design!
            </p>

            <p>In essense, while they are very different things, we can already find correlations of
            the Western science of Green Design with <i>Feng Shui</i>. <i>Feng Shui</i> seeks to find the balance
            between Human, Earth (nature), and the Universe, while Green Design is centered on designing with
            human, environmental, and social context in mind. Even though the means and societal views of
            Feng Shui and Green Design are very different, they are actually very similar in essence, and
            are working towards the same values. </p>

            <h1><i>Yin Yang</i>: a general overview</h1>
            <p>Translated literally, <i>Yin Yang</i> means "darkness" and "light".
                In this principle of <i>Feng Shui</i>, everything must be balanced between Yin (darkness) and Yang (light).
            The concept of balance is the main pillar of this concept, where "darkness" and "light"
            can be meant literally in terms of aesthetic color, but also more metaphorical ideas such as the sun and the moon, hot and cold, etc. </p>
            <p>The concept of <i>Yin Yang</i> can be reflected in environmental design through finding
            balance between the natural and the built environment, the contrasts of heating and cooling when designing
            for human comfort, and more.</p>

        <div id ="chi" style ="display: none">
            <h1><i>Chi</i>: a general overview</h1>
            <p><i>Chi</i> (or <i>Qi</i>), translated literatly as "air" but usually understood as "energy flow",
                exists in every aspect of life, and, on Earth,
                it is carried by wind and water (reminder that <i>Feng Shui</i> translates to wind and water).
                <i>Feng Shui</i> designs in the built environment are aimed at a balance and harmonious environments
                that can produce an ample amount of good <i>Chi</i> and filter out the bad <i>Chi</i>.

            </p>
            <p> While <i>Chi</i> is not limited to wind,
                the mindfulness of these principles mirror that of
                finding the balance between ventilation and insulation in
                the built environment in environmental design.

        <div id ="fiveelements" style ="display: none">
            <h1>The Five Elements: a general overview</h1>
            <p>According to Feng Shui, everything in the world is part of the five elements: fire, earth, metal, water, and wood.
                These elements form productive and destructive cycles and are seen through process and change. </p>
            <p>The changing and cyclical nature of the Five elements are similar to the concepts around circular design, reuse, and the “cradle to cradle” concepts in environmental design.</p>

        <div id ="applied" style ="display: none">
            <h1>Appling <i>Feng Shui</i> to Site Selection</h1>
            <p>If we apply the principles of <i>Yin Yang</i>, <i>Chi</i>, and the five elements, we can
                pick an ideal site for a building to minimize environmental impact.
                A favorable site should have a balance between <i>Yin</i> and <i>Yang</i>. For example, surrounding hills
                (<i>Yin</i>) and a meandering river (<i>Yang</i>) suggest an ideal location. The consideration of <i>Chi</i> points to South
                being the best direction for a building to face.
                This enables the structure to use sunlight and block the winds from the north.</p>
            <p>From a built environment stand point, this site selection is also ideal. Having hills minimizes abrasive winds
            during the winter to lower heating costs, while being close to water can allow more localized water use. Meanwhile, a
            South facing building can maximize solar gain and create an excellent form of heating and passive lighting,
            especially when paired with windows and shades to allow for customization.</p>

        <div id ="casestudy" style ="display: none">
            <h1>Case Study: Workspace6</h1>
            <p>When applied to a well designed building in terms of environmental impact, they also tend to
                use good <i>Feng Shui</i> principles as well.For example, in the case of Workplace6, an office building
                in Sydney. It is the first commercial development to achieve a 6 star Green Star rating for design in the
                New South Wales region of Australia. It is designed to reduce greenhouse emissions by 70% and cut
                drinking water consumption by almost 90% compared to an average existing office building. It
                employs sustainable design tactics such as: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Uses 25% Green Power drawn from wind and solar sources</li>
                <li>Contains roof mounted solar panels to heat the building’s hot water supply </li>
                <li>Contains a black water recycling system that will treat sewage on-site </li>
                <li>Built using recycled materials</li>
                <li>Maximizes natural light with central atrium and optimize indoor environment quality through the use of chilled beam technology
                </li>
                <li>Maximizes window openings overlooking Sydney city and harbour for ventilation
                </li>
                <li>Uses a high technology facade and sun shading devices to reduce heat load on the building.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>After the application of these environmental design strategies, the design automatically fit many principles
                of <i>Feng Shui</i> as well. For example, out of the principles of <i>Yin Yang</i>, <i>Chi</i>, and the five elements, we can see that: </p>
            <p><b><i>Yin Yang</i>:</b> Open central atrium similar to the traditional courtyard houses in Beijing that provided the balance between natural and built environment, <i>Yin</i> and <i>Yang</i> harmony
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><i>Chi</i>:</b> Connecting interior spaces to exterior through natural light from windows and central atrium, maximized external view to Sydney harbour, and greater fresh air supply
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Five Elements:</b> Usage of onsite water/energy treatment & recycled materials
            </p>
