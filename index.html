            <h1>Orchestra Deconstructed Artist Statement</h1>
            <p>Walk around the room. What do you see? What do you hear? What do you feel? Try sitting on one of the chairs. Try a different chair. Try it with some friends.

                As someone who has played in orchestras for almost a decade, the sudden inability to create music with other people in the same space brought about by COVID-19 was something on the top of my mind since March 2020. Throughout the past two years, I've seen efforts of recreating this magical in-person experience, or the "virtual orchestra" trend, with varying degrees of success, but these virtual reproductions all feel as though they are missing something. What exactly makes up an orchestra? Is it the music? Is it the musicians? Is it being in the same space to appreciate music as others? What would the orchestral experience be like if we slowly take away these elements? 
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Orchestra, Deconstructed</i> is a year-long study of the live orchestra, drawing upon the power of technology to reimagine its very concept. Throughout this process, I began thinking not only about the physical space an orchestra takes up but also how it came to be this way. I reflected on what it means to be an orchestral musician, and what happens when orchestral musicians are no longer playing with a larger whole. I also reflected on both the beauty and resiliency of music, as well as the exclusivity and inaccessibility associated with the western orchestra.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the pieces featured in my exhibit, I chose works composed by living female composers. <i>Abendstern</i> by Lauren Bernofsky depicts the Bavarian countryside at night, where the evening star - "Abendstern" - shines brightly. <i>Starburst</i> by Jessie Montgomery plays on the imagery of the various colors and textures of exploding stars. "Coquetos" from <i>Leyendas: An Andean Walkabout</i> by Gabriela Lena Frank mixes elements of Andean folk music with western classical, and draws upon love songs sung traditionally by romanceros against a <i>vendaval de guitarras</i> ("storm of guitars"). 
            </p>
            <p>
                The theme of stars that emerged from these pieces was mostly accidental, but fitting. As you walk through and experience my exhibit, I hope you take the time to think about yourself in the space, the different pieces in this space, how the sounds interact with each other and as a larger whole, and enjoy the music.
